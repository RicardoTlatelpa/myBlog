### The War Of Art by Steven Pressfield

An amazing book that teaches philosophies that I learned to live by and personally couldn’t continue my career without. An author that talks about the war against yourself, or the never ending battle against the resistance in your mind. Everyone faces some sort of resistance, and it can come in many forms, procrastination, or a desire to distract yourself, anything that doesn’t mean work. Now, life doesn’t revolve around work, but it’s something that can’t be avoided.


Before this book I used to procrastinate...a lot, a whole lot. I was the type of student to finish a big project a day before it was due. I would collect all the small tasks I could have broken up for the week before, and do it overnight, leaving me with no hours of sleep. These behaviors were ok to do in college and high school, but usually the result is mediocre and as projects get more complex, the work just gets even more mediocre. I couldn’t continue this type of lifestyle especially when I wanted to take something like programming serious, but something was still in the way…

#### Loneliness 

Starting to code is not only a challenge but it's also a lonely road. There would be days where I would think ‘So this is what i’m going to do for the rest of my life? Sit by a computer and code all day long?’ I felt like an outcast, but luckily there was a section in this book that addressed that issue. It wasn’t my emotion that was preventing me from doing my work, it was the resistance to work hiding in the form of emotion. Yes, I truly believe that the resistance of sitting down and coding, and getting shit done, heightened these thoughts of loneliness. Steven pressfield, the author of this book, spoke to me in volumes when he mentioned his ‘lonely’ experiences. Loneliness is only a bump in the road when you have conquered your inner resistance. 

	His experience as a writer is lonely. He has to sit and write, and come up with brilliant ideas. A musician has to do the same thing, practice their craft all day long, be fully engaged in what they’re doing. That’s when it clicked, it’s just me and my work, and every thought I had about loneliness faded. I no longer felt lonesome, rather I felt excited to engage myself more into my work, and sharpen my coding craft, and so I did.
